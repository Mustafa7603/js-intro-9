    -tools or symbols used for math, comparison, logical and more operations with data

    Assignement operatior: =
    arithmatic operators: used more math calculations
    +,-,/,%,

++ increase by one
-- decrease by one



because careful for using + sign because it is used for concatanation and addition
string + string = concatanation
number + number = addition
string + number = concatanation

'a' + 1 + 2 + 3
= 'a123

'a' +(1+2+3)
"a6"

1+2+3+'a'
='6a'

comparison operators
2 == 2  true
5 - 2 == 3  true
2 * 5 == 20 / 2   true
5 != 2   true
2 != 2   false

'3' == 3  true
'3' === 3  false
3 === 3   true
'3' === '3' true 
'hello' === 'hello' true


0= false
true = 1
x=10 y=20 z='10'

(x<=z) = < y
this = 1 < 20 = true

false
0
{}
[]
NaN
''
undefined
null

any number even negative biside 0 is true

logical operators 
&&= and
||= or
!= not

with && you will get the result true omly if all espression
are true

with || you will get true when one or both epressions are true
only way to get false if all espression are false

?? is going to result in first expression if the frist expression is
not null or undefined


null ?? anything ---- is going to be anything
undefined ?? anything ----is going to anything

X ?? Y -----  X Its always going to be the frist one
